# Better Yo (Chrome Extension)

One morning, I download the [Yo](http://justyo.co) Chrome extension and decompressed it and made some changes:
- You can now send a basic Yo (the original only does YOLINK)
- You can now send a Yo with your location in-browser
- You can swipe left and right (as like the in the app) to view their profile or the CANCEL/DELETE/BLOCK buttons.
- When you send a Yo, their profile goes to the top of the screen.
- Performance improvements.
- The UI is vastly improved to be more responsive and accounts for Rate limiting, invalid usernames and just beautifulness.

The extension itself is live on the Google Chrome Webstore and [can be found here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/better-yo/hckkeplhmlafhhikfphkbcekphbngfcl).

Note: This version is far more improved even than the one on Chrome webstore. If you want the latest stable version, go download the version above. If you want the most bleeding edge version, `git clone` this repository and locally install it.
